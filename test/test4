gate A const 1.0
gate B not 1.0
wire A true B in 1.0
-- B out will have a true pulse from time 1 to time 3

gate C not 0.001
wire B out C in 0.001
-- C out will have a false pulse from just after time 1 to time 3

-- applying a true pulse to D in2 sets the outputs to false
-- applying a false pulse to E in2 sets the outputs to true
gate D or 1.0
gate E and 1.0
wire D out E in1 0.2
wire E out D in1 0.2

-- so now, try to set and reset D and E simultaneously
wire B out D in2 1.000
wire C out E in2 0.998
